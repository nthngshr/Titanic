# Titanic
It's a testing repo. Here I'm learning how to use jupyter localy in vscode commiting to github. I've decided on a standard titanic dataset and do a classification step by step according 'Machine Learning Pocket Reference'. Besides, I added some changes into the initial code from the book.

See the initial code in the book:
